## Project description
I plan to use the Heart Disease UCI dataset from Kaggle, which contains clinical measures such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. Our goal is to apply deep learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease based on these features.

I will experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters, testing at least 4-5 parameter variations and 1-2 architectures. The model performance will be evaluated on both training and test datasets, focusing on optimizing accuracy and generalizability.
